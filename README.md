# iiif-osd-expts

Container for some experiments with OpenSeadragon (OSD).

OSD supports overlays: https://openseadragon.github.io/examples/ui-overlays/

* They can be shapes that scale with the image.
* They can be point markers
* You can reference an element in the DOM and OSD will use it as the overlay

I want to see how far this can be pushed. 

* Sticking to HTML5, can we get a video playing in an overlay that scales with the OSD world?
* Can we get a region of a video (particular xywh) playing?
* What else can we do with HTML5 canvas overlaid on OSD?
